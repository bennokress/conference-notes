## Abstract

After two decades of building everything from app icons to books to games, I've learned that what lasts isn't efficiency or optimisation, but the details that spark joy. In this talk I'll share stories from my own work to show how personality and emotional design turn ordinary products into memorable ones, and why that extra effort matters.

## Key Takeaways

### Outside

Weather app that shows the current weather as if through a window.

**Lesson 1**: Design for retelling.

Novelty is strong.
Idea itself was very human and shareable.

If people can explain your idea in one sentence, it travels.
If it's hard to explain, it's hard to remember.

### Thermo

Theme store: buy different thermometers.

**Lesson 2**: Take one idea further than feels reasonable.

Diamond encrusted thermometer that costs a lot of money.

**Lesson 3**: Add one detail that has no functional justification.

Just because you think it's fun.
Smile-driven development: optimise for smiles.

Examples:
- PocketShelf: membership card that you can sign.
- Captions: Film-style packages for presets.
- DarkNoise: App Icons created by Charlie's young kids.
- One Sec: Team photo gallery carousel.
- Helm: "Just kidding, Helm will remember you are logged in."

### The iOS/macOS **App Icon Book**

**Lesson 4**: Over-invest in first impressions

Iridescent front cover.

The app icon is a user's first impression.
First impressions decide whether anything else matters.

**Lesson 5**: Design the Aftermoment

People remember the unexpected and how things end.

App Icon colouring book.
Vintage box art for software.
Atari-style artwork for apps.
Enamel pins.

### DinoLords

**Lesson 6**: Make decisions only you would make.

Example: Viking peeing on fallen soldier.

Be opinionated and encode those opinions into your products.
If anyone could have made this decision, it probably won't be remembered.

**Lesson 7**: Orchestrate emotional payoff.

Understand what the user is emotionally investing in then deliberately pay it off.
Don't just ship features, orchestrate moments.

You are absolutely **not** guaranteed success.
But you may have changed the odds in your favour.
