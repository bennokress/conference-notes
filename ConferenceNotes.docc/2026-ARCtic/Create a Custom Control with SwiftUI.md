## Abstract

This session explores the decision-making process behind building custom controls in SwiftUI. It starts by examining the benefits of using built-in components, and why they are often the right choice for familiarity, accessibility, and platform consistency.

For situations where a custom control meaningfully enhances the user experience, we'll use a case study of a custom radial filter menu. This example demonstrates how to design and implement a delightful custom control, covering advanced layout techniques, expressive animations, accessibility best practices, and modern design paradigms such as Liquid Glass.
