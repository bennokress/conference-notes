## Abstract

Ever spent 4 hours automating a 5-minute task? Congratulations, you're a developer! As developers, we're told to "move fast and ship," but what if I told you that spending time on automation could actually save your sanity AND your app store ratings?

Join me for a humorous journey through the wonderful world of iOS automation - from simple git hooks that prevent you from committing broken code at 2 AM, to full CI/CD pipelines that deploy to TestFlight while you sleep. We'll explore when automation makes sense (hint: more often than you think), when it doesn't (yes, that's a thing), and how to convince yourself that yes, you DO deserve nice things, even as a solo developer.

Through real-world examples, war stories, and the occasional existential crisis about whether robots will replace us (spoiler: they already have, and we built them), you'll learn practical automation strategies that work for teams of one to one hundred. Because life's too short to manually increment build numbers, and your users deserve better than "oops, I forgot to run the tests."
