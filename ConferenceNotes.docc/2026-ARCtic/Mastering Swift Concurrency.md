## Abstract

Master Swift's modern concurrency model by solving real-world challenges in a fun and interactive session. This hands-on workshop for intermediate to advanced developers covers async/await, actors, isolation domains, and Swift 6's strict concurrency checking and 6.2's approachable concurrency. Through practical coding exercises, you'll learn to prevent data races at compile time, understand actor reentrancy, implement the Sendable protocol correctly, and learn to migrate existing codebases to Swift 6's strictest safety guarantees. Leave with working code, deep understanding of isolation patterns, and confidence to build thread-safe apps that pass Swift 6 strict checking in production.
