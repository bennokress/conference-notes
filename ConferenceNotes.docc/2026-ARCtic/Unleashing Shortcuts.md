## Abstract

Shortcuts have been part of Apple's ecosystem since 2017, yet many developers barely scratch the surface of what's possible. In this hands-on workshop, you'll discover how to automate your daily workflows – from simple one-tap actions like opening the Updates Section inside the App Store to complex multi-app orchestrations powered by custom App Intents written in Swift. Whether you're new to Shortcuts or ready to level up shortcuts you already created, you'll leave with practical automations tailored to your needs. No prior Shortcuts experience required, just bring your iPhone, your MacBook, and curiosity!
