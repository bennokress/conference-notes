## Abstract

Maintaining a clean, well-organized codebase becomes increasingly challenging as projects grow and as more people try vibe coding. This talk explores how to leverage static analysis tools like Periphery to not only identify unused code, but to actively guide better code organization and encapsulation practices. We'll start with an introduction to Periphery and its benefits, then demonstrate how extending it with custom analysis and visualization can help developers identify naming inconsistencies, understand hierarchical relationships between SwiftUI views, and make informed decisions about file organization. With author's new PeripheryTree, we'll see how visualizing code relationships can reveal opportunities for better encapsulation, suggest file reorganization based on view hierarchies, and ultimately help maintain a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
