## Abstract

In this workshop, we'll work with your existing SwiftUI app. We'll use an open source library called Prefire to convert all of your Previews into snapshot tests. A large conversion like this can create noisy tests, so we'll also show you how to handle potential flakiness by storing screenshots in Screenshotbot.

We'll set it up so that each time you open a Pull Request (GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket), you'll get a notification on your Pull Request with all the Preview changes in your PR.

You're welcome to use your real projects, but we'll also provide a sample SwiftUI project for you to play with.
