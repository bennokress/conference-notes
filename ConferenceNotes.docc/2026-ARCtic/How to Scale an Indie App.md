## Abstract

In this talk, I explain how I scaled my app "one sec" from 1 user to 1 Million hourly active users in the past 5 years. And all that without any investor money or loans.

What started as an experiment for myself, became a $150k MRR project over the years – helping millions of users save thousands of years from scrolling *every single week*.

How did I get there?

I will show you my strategies and how I took advantage of being indie to marketize my project to a broader audience.

## Key Takeaways

### Why is it important to keep investors out?

You will end up having to prioritise profit over user impact.
VC Money leads to enshitification.

Impact & users > profit.

We need to strike a balance between quality and visibility.
You need both.
