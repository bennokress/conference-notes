## Abstract

In this talk, I explain how I scaled my app "one sec" from 1 user to 1 Million hourly active users in the past 5 years. And all that without any investor money or loans.

What started as an experiment for myself, became a $150k MRR project over the years – helping millions of users save thousands of years from scrolling *every single week*.

How did I get there?

I will show you my strategies and how I took advantage of being indie to market my project to a broader audience.

## Key Takeaways

### Why is it important to keep investors out?

You will end up having to prioritise profit over user impact.
VC Money leads to enshittification.

Impact & users > profit.

We need to strike a balance between quality and visibility.
You need both.

### Quality

Solving my own problems.

2-2-2 Jordi Bruin.
2 hours: ensure technical feasibility.
2 days: TestFlight version to send to friends.
2 weeks: App Store availability.

Ship ASAP and charge for it immediately.
Use your app! (Dogfooding)
Ask yourself: do you enjoy your app? Do your friends and early customers?
If yes, proceed and dedicate more time. If no, abort early.

### Scaling

Competition has money, you don't.
There comes a point where you put in 18-hour workdays.
With that will come money and with it you can and should hire employees:
Designer, Coder, Customer Service, Marketing.

### Visibility

Brand it visibly as an indie app.
Show your face! Remain authentic!
Privacy, Quality, Native, Fast → everything a VC-backed app hasn't.

### Discovery

Takes place across social media. No ads.
Tell interesting stories involving the app.
Idea & Authenticity > Quality.
Don't post stories for the sake of content.

Story Structure:
1. Hook
2. Fulfil it with one killer feature
3. Tell the story

### Other Tips

- Collaborate with researchers
- Collaborate with other indie apps
