## Abstract

The most important part of any app is its users. If they're not engaged, your app will be off their phones faster than it got there. In this talk, we'll cover practical, industry-proven strategies to increase user engagement and ensure your users keep coming back.

## Key Takeaways

### Habit Loop

Cue → Action → Reward → Cue

Reward triggers dopamine.
Next cue then triggers a craving.
This triggers a habit.

### Rewards

Variable rewards: intermittent > predictable.
Anticipation > reward.

### Streaks:

Loss aversion.
Early streaks motivate most.
Recovery reduces drop-off.
Show progress, not just totals.
Social visibility

Endowment effect - users overvalue what they already have.
→ Current streak is irreplaceable, even though a new one can be started.

### Achievements:

Reward meaningful behaviours and signal competence.
Social visibility: visible enough to inspire, subtle enough to avoid stress.
Pair them with real-life milestones.

Scarcity.
Tiered systems: bronze, silver, gold
Distinct but not overwhelming.

### Push notifications

External cue: align with peak user attention.
Consistent time for habit-forming.
Reinforce the behaviour that you want to encourage.

### Visual prominence

High contrast elements demand user attention.
Warmth signals urgency.
Dynamic colour can act as a reward, reinforcing the habit.

### The numbers

**Variable Rewards**: 20-50% increase
**Streaks**: 10-50% increase
**Achievements**: 22-30% increase
**Push**: 26% increase in app opens
**Push + Badges**: 88% increase in app opens
**Visual Prominence**: 35% increase

Focus on outcomes, not engagement.
Track products relative to goals.
