## Abstract

Swift evolves constantly, and while new big features like concurrency get most of the attention, the language also keeps refining in smaller, quieter ways. Some features often go unnoticed, yet they are the ones that can add clarity and a touch of delight to the everyday Swift code we write. In this talk, we'll explore some of these hidden gems, and look into small improvements that can be integrated into any project on any platform. I'll share a collection of my favorite Swift techniques and language details that make code cleaner, or even faster, and easier to reason about.
