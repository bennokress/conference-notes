#  Driving User Engagement in your App
## Janina Kutyn

## Habit Loop

Cue -> Action -> Reward -> Cue

Reward triggers dopamine.
Next cue then triggers a craving.
This triggers a habit.

## Rewards

Variable rewards: intermittent > predictable.
Anticipation > reward.

## Streaks: 

Loss aversion.
Early streaks motivate most.
Recovery reduces drop-off.
Show progress, not just totals.
Social visibility

Endowment effect - users overvalue what they already have.
-> Current streak is irreplaceable, even though an new one can be started.

## Achievements:

Reward behaviours and signal confidence.
Social visibility: visible enough to inspire, subtle enough to avoid stress.
Pair them with real-life milestones.

Scarcity.
Tiered systems: bronze, silver, gold
Distinct but not overwhelming.

## Push notifications

External cue: align with peak user attention.
Consistent time for habit-forming.
Reinforce the behaviour that you want to encourage.

## Visual prominence

High contract elements demand user attention.
Warmth signals urgency.
Dynamic colour can act as a reward, reinforcing the habit.

## The numbers

**Streaks**: 10% increase
**Achievements**: 22% increase
**Push**: 26% increase in app opens
